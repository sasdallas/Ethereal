IMPORTANT
===============================================

libpolyhedron was HEAVILY inspired by the ToaruOS libc, including some of its functions and macros.
Examples include __sets_errno and DEFINE_SYSCALL.

This does not mean the code is supposed to be "retyped", "copied", etc. and rather means that the design is inspired.
A retype or copy should ALWAYS have a proper header at the top referencing the source. Please see the root README.MD for copyright issues.
