This section defines the xHCI Runtime Register space. The base address of this
register space is referred to as Runtime Base. The Runtime Base shall be 32-
byte aligned and is calculated by adding the value Runtime Register Space
Offset register (refer to Section 5.3.8) to the Capability Base address. All
Runtime registers are multiples of 32 bits in length.
Unless otherwise stated, all registers should be accessed with Dword references
on reads, with an appropriate software mask if needed. A software
read/modify/write mechanism should be invoked for partial writes.
Software should write registers containing a Qword address field using only
Qword references. If a system is incapable of issuing Qword references, then

Address: Operational Base + (400h + (10h * (n–1)))
where: n = Port Number (Valid values are 1, 2, 3, … MaxPorts)
Default: Field dependent
Attribute: RO, RW, RW1C (field dependent)
Size 32 bits

A host controller shall implement one or more port registers. The number of
port registers implemented by a particular instantiation of a host controller is
documented in the HCSPARAMS1 register (Section 5.3.3). Software uses this 
370 Document Number: 625472, Revision: 1.2b

information as an input parameter to determine how many ports need to be
serviced. All ports have the structure defined below.
This register is in the Aux Power well. It is only reset by platform hardware
during a cold reset or in response to a Host Controller Reset (HCRST). The
initial conditions of a port are described in Section 4.19.

Note: Port Status Change Events cannot be generated if the xHC is stopped
(HCHalted (HCH) = ‘1’). Refer to section 4.19.2 for more information about
change flags.

Note: Software shall ensure that the xHC is running (HCHalted (HCH) = ‘0’) before
attempting to write to this register.
Software cannot change the state of the port unless Port Power (PP) is asserted
(‘1’), regardless of the Port Power Control (PPC) capability (section 5.3.6). The
host is required to have power stable to the port within 20 milliseconds of the
‘0’ to ‘1’ transition of PP. If PPC = ‘1’ software is responsible for waiting 20 ms.
after asserting PP, before attempting to change the state of the port.

Note: If a port has been assigned to the Debug Capability, then the port shall not
report device connected (that is, CCS = ‘0’) and enabled when the Port Power
Flag is ‘1’. Refer to Section 7.6 for more information on the xHCI Debug
Capability operation.
